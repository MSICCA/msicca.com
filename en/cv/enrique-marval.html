        <h3>Mission Profile</h3>
        <p>
          Enrique Marval bridges the gap between US Federal Standards
          (NEC/NFPA/OSHA) and local operational realities in the Zulia region.
          With nearly two decades of field experience in hostile and austere
          environments, he specializes in critical infrastructure stabilization
          and leads MSICCA deployment teams to execute mandates with local
          logistical precision, full regulatory compliance, and strict safety
          protocols.

        <h3>Core Competencies (Operational)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Regulatory bridge: translation of US execution requirements (NEC
            2023 / IEEE Std 142) into local action plans, mitigating liability
            risks for Prime Contractors through strict QA/QC.
          </li>
          <li>
            Facility hardening: rapid assessment and retrofitting of dilapidated
            infrastructure to restore operational capacity (power, HVAC, water).
          </li>
          <li>
            Grid stability and power assurance: design and deployment of prime
            and backup power generation, synchronization, and fuel logistics
            integration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Supply chain resilience: management of local procurement logistics,
            vetting suppliers to ensure a clean supply chain free from
            sanctioned entities (FCPA compliant).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Past Performance (Technical Complexity)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Critical water infrastructure stabilization:</strong>
            electrical system assessment and re-engineering for municipal water
            well fields and pumping stations, restoring supply capability under
            severe grid instability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthcare facility retrofit (Category 1 spaces):</strong>
            electrical hardening of intensive care units and surgical theaters
            in public health infrastructure, delivering isolated power systems
            compliant with safety codes for life-support equipment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Renewable energy integration (remote locations):</strong>
            conceptual and detailed engineering for photovoltaic systems
            (microgrids) in off-grid regions, providing autonomous power for
            humanitarian logistics hubs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Mass transit power systems:</strong> QA/QC supervision for
            traction substations and passenger stations within a major urban
            rail system, validating compliance of electromechanical assemblies
            prior to commissioning.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>International grid interconnection analysis:</strong>
            engineering review for a 7.91 MW photovoltaic generation system
            (USA), verifying interconnection compliance with National Grid (13.2
            kV) standards.
